### A HUGE THANKS!!
A very special thanks to [@csleong98](https://github.com/csleong98) for designing our logo!

Huge props to [@andreasgruenh](https://github.com/andreasgruenh) and [@ktilcu](https://github.com/ktilcu) for helping collaborate.

And the biggest of credit goes to all of our awesome [Contributors](https://github.com/BlakeGuilloud/ganon/graphs/contributors)!!

### Usage
```bash
$ yarn add ganon
```

NodeJS
```javascript
// import { sum } from 'ganon';
const { sum } = require('ganon');

const sumOfOneAndTwo = sum(1, 2);
=> 3
```

Javascript
```javascript
// import sum from 'ganon/dist/sum';
const sum = require('ganon/dist/sum');

const sumOfOneAndTwo = sum(1, 2);
=> 3
```

### Objective
To build a suite of javascript methods by the time [hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) ends! Let's get some T-shirts!!

Ganon is designed to get as many people involved as possible, so our objective here is to fix or improve an existing method and then write the skeleton of a desired method for someone else to build. In the spirit of getting everyone involved, please only fix one or two methods and make sure to push up something for someone else to work on!

This project was created to have fun.

### Project Structure
All methods will live in the `lib` directory of the project. They should be written as [methodName].js, required and exported in `lib/index.js`.

All tests will live in the `test` directory. A test file should be formatted `[methodName].test.js` to reflect what method is being tested.

### Contributing
Please read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/BlakeGuilloud/ganon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to contribute to this project! All skill levels are more than welcome to participate in this project!

### Demo
We're going to walk through the process of taking on an issue, resolving it, writing a new issue, and shipping some code.

The method we are going to resolve is called `sum`:

```javascript
// lib/sum.js

function sum(a, b) {
// Your code goes here.
}

module.exports = sum;
```

In order to test this method, we will first run `yarn test sum`:

```bash
$ yarn test sum

  FAIL  problems/sum.test.js
    ✕ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (8ms)
    ✕ adds 3 + 4 to equal 7 (1ms)

    ● adds 1 + 2 to equal 3

      expect(received).toBe(expected)

      Expected value to be (using ===):
        3
      Received:
        undefined
```

As you can see, there is something wrong with the function sum, so let's resolve it:

```javascript
// lib/sum.js

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = sum;
```

Run the test again:

```bash
$ yarn test sum
  
  PASS  problems/sum.test.js
    ✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (6ms)
    ✓ adds 3 + 4 to equal 7 (1ms)
```

Now that I have fixed the sum function to return the desired value, I need to write the skeleton of a new method for other contributors to work on. Let's write one called `difference`:

```javascript
// lib/difference.js

// Write a function that returns the difference of the first two parameters

function difference(a, b) {
// Your code goes here.
}

module.exports = difference;
```

We will need to accompany this method with a test(s) to ensure it returns the proper value:

```javascript
// test/difference.test.js

const { difference } = require("../lib");

describe("difference", () => {
  test("subtracts 1 - 3 to equal -2", () => {
    expect(difference(1, 3)).toBe(-2);
  });

  test("subtracts 10 - 3 to equal 7", () => {
    expect(difference(10, 3)).toBe(7);
  });
});

```

Now that we have fixed a method, written the skeleton of a new method, and a test to accompany it, we can push up our changes and open a pull request. :fire: :fire: :fire:
