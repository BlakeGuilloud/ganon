/**
 * Accepts a red, blue, and green component of a color in RGB space and return
 * the same color represented by its hue, saturation, and value.
 *
 * @param {Array} An array containing the red component of the color in its 0th
 *                index, the blue green componenet in its 1st index, and the
 *                red component in its 2nd index. ex: [150, 50, 50]
 *
 * @return {Array} An array containing the hue component of the color in its
 *                 0th index, saturation component in its 1st index, and the
 *                 value in its 3rd index. The hue should be rounded to the
 *                 nearest integer, and the saturation and value components
 *                 should be rounded to 3 decimal places.
 *                 ex: rgb2hsv([160, 110, 250]) returns [261, .56, .98]
