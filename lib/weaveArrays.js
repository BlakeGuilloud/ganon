/** 
 * `weaveArrays` takes two arrays and combines them into a new array 
 * by alternating values from the first and second arrays.
 * 
 * The resulting array should begin with the first element from the first array, 
 * followed by the first element from the second array, then the second element from the first array, 
 * and so on, until the end of either the first or the second array has been reached and 
 * the resulting array ends with an element from the second array.
 *
 * Example: weaveArrays( [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] ) === [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
 *  
 * The function should combine the given arrays only if all values in the first array AND 
 * all values in the second array are of the same type. Otherwise it should throw an error 
 * indicating that mismatched types have been provided.
 * 
 * @param   { Array } firstArray: an array containing any type of values
 * @param   { Array } secondArray: an array containing any type of values
 * @returns { Array } a new array containing values from both of the given arrays
